# .gitignore Configuration Summary

## Data Files Protection

The `.gitignore` file has been configured to exclude all large data files while preserving the directory structure:

### Excluded Files
```
# IEEE Fraud Detection Dataset files
data/raw/*.csv              # All CSV files in raw data directory
data/processed/*.pkl         # Processed pickle files  
data/processed/*.pt          # Processed PyTorch tensors
data/graphs/*.pt            # Graph data structures
data/graphs/*.pkl           # Graph pickle files

# Model outputs  
results/models/*.pt         # Trained PyTorch models
results/models/*.pth        # PyTorch state dictionaries
results/models/*.pkl        # Model pickle files
```

### Preserved Structure
```
# Directory structure is maintained via .gitkeep files
!data/raw/.gitkeep
!data/processed/.gitkeep  
!data/graphs/.gitkeep
!results/models/.gitkeep
!results/models/checkpoints/.gitkeep
!results/models/trained/.gitkeep
```

### Additional Exclusions
- Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- Virtual environments (`venv/`, `.env`)
- IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Log files (`*.log`, `logs/`)
- System files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

## Benefits

1. **Repository Size**: Keeps repository lightweight by excluding large data files
2. **Version Control**: Focuses on code changes rather than data changes  
3. **Collaboration**: Prevents accidental commits of large datasets
4. **Directory Structure**: Maintains project organization with .gitkeep files
5. **Flexibility**: Allows local data storage without git tracking

## Data Download Required

Since data files are excluded, users must download the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset manually:

1. Follow instructions in `README.md` 
2. Place files in `data/raw/` directory
3. Run `python diagnostic.py` to verify installation

This approach ensures the repository remains clean while providing clear instructions for data setup.

## System Requirements & Common Issues

### Python Version Requirements
- **Minimum**: Python 3.8+
- **Current Issue**: Python 3.6 detected (not supported)
- **Solution**: Upgrade Python to 3.8 or higher

### Missing Dependencies
Based on diagnostic results, install missing packages:

```bash
# Core missing packages
pip install torch-geometric networkx loguru

# Alternative PyTorch Geometric installation (if above fails)
pip install torch-geometric -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.10.0+cpu.html

# Complete environment setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Hardware Configuration
- **CUDA**: Optional (CPU mode available)
- **Memory**: Minimum 8GB RAM recommended for large dataset processing
- **Storage**: ~2GB for dataset files (excluded from git)

### Diagnostic Summary
Run `python diagnostic.py` to check:
- ✅ Data files downloaded and placed correctly
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Python environment compatible
- ✅ Project structure intact

### Environment Setup Recommendations
1. Use Python 3.8+ virtual environment
2. Install PyTorch Geometric with proper CUDA support if available
3. Verify all dependencies before running main system
4. Check data files are in correct `data/raw/` location
